        <h2>Father of Alternating Current (AC) Electricity</h2>
        <p><b>Nikola Tesla</b>, born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan (now Croatia), was a Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer best known for developing the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which became the global standard for power distribution. His notable inventions include the Tesla coil, essential for wireless communication, and innovations in electromagnetism that laid the groundwork for radio technology. Tesla's visionary ideas extended to concepts like wireless energy transmission and renewable energy, significantly impacting modern electrical engineering. He passed away on January 7, 1943, but his legacy continues to inspire innovation and technology today.</p>
